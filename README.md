# Proof of concepts related to REST-API-Projects using J2EE
This repository contains workflows in Java related to different REST based service applications like:
1) Token_verification
2) SendGrid_Proxy
3) SharePoint-REST-API-Framework

# 1) Token_verification Details:
Each and every folder is a Web Application Resource Project using Maven and written in JAVA using REST API's. Technical documentation is present in each and every workflow folder as follows:

    1) Token_Verification: Token_Verification/Token Based Verification.docx

# Technical Features: 

            Framework :       Spring
            Architecture:     MVC
            Language:         Java 1.8
            Webservice type:  REST


# 2) SendGrid_Proxy
This repository contains workflow which helps in capturing the SendGrid implementation including capturing the details of an email in database along with capturing SendGrid server side fail over scenarios.

# Description:

SendGrid email API will capture all the server side bounce backs/ failures with in sendgrid, but applications must fetch bounce backs/ failures and create a report accordingly. To achieve this, we need to set up a proxy layer between our application and SendGrid to fetch bounce backs/ failures.

Technical design details are captured in SendGrid Proxy Workflow Design Document "SendGrid Proxy Workflow Design Document.docx"


# 3) SharePoint-REST-API-Framework
This repository contains workflow in Java which helps with predefined methods to interact with SharePoint through REST API.

# Proof of concepts related to Basic Java
This repository also contains basic java programs like:
1) Csv_RandomData_Generator.

# 1) Csv_RandomData_Generator: 
This folder provides java code related to random data generators for required columns and writing the data into csv files. This code can create n number of records and write them into CSV file.
